September 17, 2014	Alex Hammel	<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.5
		* Added indel probes
		* Added continuous integration script
		* Amino acid probes can now have 'X' as the mutation AA
		* Added '[trans]' option to probes where a transcript is specified
		* Lots of refactoring

July 14, 2014	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.4
		* Added Gene SNP Probes
		* Added Amino Acid Probes
		* Changed object architecture

May 07, 2014	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.3
		* Added SNP probes.
		* Added comments.

Apr 02, 2014 	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.2.4
		* Fix off-by-one error in determining left bound of exons.

Mar 26, 2014	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.2.3
		* Fixed issue with incorrect reverse-complementing behaviour in probe
		statements.
		* Statements which ask for an exon which is not in the annotation for
		a transcript (e.g., asking for exon 5 of a 4 exon transcript) now
		results in a warning mesage printed to stderr rather than a crash.
		* Annotations which specify chromosomes which are not in the reference
		genome (ususally unmapped contigs) now result in a warning message
		printed to stderr rather than a crash.

Mar 10, 2014	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.2.2
		* Fixed issue with incorrect reverse-complementing behaviour in
		coordinate statements.
		* Removed spaces from probe names in output FASTA headers.

Mar 06, 2014	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.2.1
		* Allow unmapped contigs as chromosome names in coordinate statements

Feb 12, 2014	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.2
		* Added read-through probe syntax ('->')
		* Made probe headers more informative
		* Suppressed printing of redundant probes

Jan 24, 2014	Alex Hammel		<ahammel@bcgsc.ca>
	* Release version 0.1
